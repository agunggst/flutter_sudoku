# Flutter Sudoku

A beautifully designed **Sudoku game built with Flutter** that combines logic, focus, and fun into a clean and engaging mobile experience. Solve puzzles, beat the timer, and enjoy a smooth custom UI designed from scratch.

## 🎯 Project Background

This project was created as part of my Flutter learning journey, developed over approximately **two weeks of focused practice and experimentation**. Instead of building small demo apps, the goal was to create a **real, playable Sudoku game** that resembles real-world application structure and behavior.

Rather than relying on templates or UI generators, every part of this game — from layout design, game flow, timer system, number pad, to win-state logic — was carefully crafted from scratch to better understand how production-like Flutter apps are built.

The main focus of this project includes:

* 🎨 UI/UX consistency
* 🧱 Clean and structured layout system
* 🎮 Interactive gameplay
* 🔄 State handling and lifecycle awareness
* 🧠 Game logic integration

Through this project, I aimed to go beyond theory and truly understand how Flutter widgets, state, and user interactions work together in a complete application.

## 🧠 Learning Insights

This project helped me understand:

* How Flutter's **layout system** really works
* Managing UI state in an interactive app
* Building reusable widgets
* Handling user input without a keyboard
* Timer-based logic
* Designing game flow (start → play → win)

One of the biggest challenges was making the UI and the user's experience feel **game-like**, not like a standard form-based Flutter app.
